- Scarb - v2.9.4
- Snforge - v0.38.2
- Cairo - v2.9.4
- Rpc - v0.7.1

## Requirements (Alternative Option with Docker)

As an alternative to installing the tools locally, you can use Docker. Here's what you need to do:

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
2. Install [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
3. Use the provided `devcontainer.json` file to set up the environment:
   - The configuration uses the `starknetfoundation/starknet-dev:2.9.2` image.
   - This includes all required tools pre-installed, such as Scarb, Starknet Foundry, Starknet Devnet and other dependencies.

### Getting Started with Docker Setup

To start using the Docker-based setup:

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Select **"Reopen in Container"**.
3. If you need to rebuild the container, open the Command Palette (**View -> Command Palette**) and choose:
   - **Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container**

> Once inside the container, you can start working with all the tools and dependencies pre-configured.

## Quickstart with Starknet-Devnet

To get started with Scaffold-Stark, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Scaffold-Stark/scaffold-stark-2.git
cd scaffold-stark-2
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal.

```bash
yarn chain
```

> To run a fork : `yarn chain --fork-network <URL> [--fork-block <BLOCK_NUMBER>]`

This command starts a local Starknet network using Devnet. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `scaffold.config.ts` for your nextjs app.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the sample contract:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a sample smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/snfoundry/contracts/src` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/snfoundry/scripts-ts/deploy.ts` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

By default `Scaffold-Stark` takes the first prefunded account from `starknet-devnet` as a deployer address,

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```bash
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

5. Check your environment variables. We have a yarn postinstall script that helps to fill in your environment variables. If the environment variable does not exist, you can fill them it manually to get the app running!

## Quickstart with Sepolia Testnet

<details>

1. Make sure you already cloned this repo and installed dependencies.

2. Prepare your environment variables.

Find the `packages/snfoundry/.env` file and fill the env variables related to Sepolia testnet with your own wallet account contract address and private key.

3. Change your default network to Sepolia testnet.

Find the `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts` file and change the `targetNetworks` to `[chains.sepolia]`.

![chall-0-scaffold-config](./packages/nextjs/public/scaffold-config.png)

4. Get some testnet tokens.

You will need to get some `ETH` or `STRK` Sepolia tokens to deploy your contract to Sepolia testnet.

> Some popular faucets are [Starknet Faucet](https://starknet-faucet.vercel.app/) and [Blastapi Starknet Sepolia Eth](https://blastapi.io/faucets/starknet-sepolia-eth)

4. Open a terminal, deploy the sample contract to Sepolia testnet:

```bash
yarn deploy --network sepolia
```

5. On a second terminal, start your NextJS app:

```bash
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

### RPC specific version

To ensure the proper functioning of the scaffold-stark with Testnet or Mainnet, your RPC version must be `0.7.1`. This repository contains a `.env.example` file, where we provided the default RPC URL for the Starknet Testnet: `RPC_URL_SEPOLIA=https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_7`. Let's verify this RPC version is `0.7.1` by calling a `POST` request in an API platform like `Postman` or `Insommia` . Your API endpoint should be `https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_7` and the body should be:

```json
{
 "jsonrpc":"2.0",
 "method":"starknet_specVersion",
 "id":1
}
```

You have to paste the endpoint and body in the API platform and click on the `Send` button. If the response is `0.7.1`, then you are good to go. Otherwise, you have to get the correct RPC URL endpoint.

![rpc-version](./packages/nextjs/public/rpc-version.png)
</details>

## Network Configuration Centralization

We've streamlined RPC provider configuration by centralizing network settings in `scaffold.config.ts`. All RPC URLs are now defined in the `rpcProviderUrl` object, and functions reference this centralized configuration instead of using environment variables directly.

**How to Change Networks:**

- Update the `targetNetworks` array in `scaffold.config.ts`.
- The first network in this array is used as the primary target.
- Ensure each network has a corresponding RPC URL specified in the `rpcProviderUrl` object.

### Required Environment Variables

For the network configuration to work correctly, you must set the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEVNET_PROVIDER_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SEPOLIA_PROVIDER_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAINNET_PROVIDER_URL`

These variables are used in the configuration to assign the correct RPC URLs:

```typescript
"devnet": process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DEVNET_PROVIDER_URL || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROVIDER_URL || "",
"sepolia": process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SEPOLIA_PROVIDER_URL || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROVIDER_URL || "",
"mainnet": process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MAINNET_PROVIDER_URL || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROVIDER_URL || ""
```

### RPC specific version

To ensure the proper functioning of Scaffold-Stark with Testnet or Mainnet, your RPC version must be `0.7.1`. This repository contains a `.env.example` file with the default RPC URL for Starknet Testnet:

#### External Image Source Configuration

In the `next.config.mjs`, we've set up external image sources using `remotePatterns` to allow fetching assets from specific domains. This is particularly useful for loading images or assets from external servers or services.

```javascript
remotePatterns: [
  // External image source for StarkNet ID identicons
  {
    protocol: "https",
    hostname: "identicon.starknet.id",
    pathname: "/**", // Allows all paths under this domain
  },
  // External image source for images hosted on Starkurabu
  {
    protocol: "https",
    hostname: "img.starkurabu.com",
    pathname: "/**",
  },
],
```

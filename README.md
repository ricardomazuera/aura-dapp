# 🌈 Aura dApp – Purposeful Habits with On-Chain Proof
**This is an open source project — contributions are welcome!**

**Aura** is a wellness-focused dApp that helps you build spiritual and biohacking habits. It allows users to create a custom habit, stick to it for 7 consecutive days, and receive an **Aura NFT** as a proof of achievement — minted on the blockchain.

This MVP was built as a simple, frictionless Web3 experience designed for **non-crypto users**.  
**✨ 80% of the design and development was assisted by Artificial Intelligence.**

## 🚀 What does Aura do?

1. Lets you create a personalized habit (e.g., “meditate 10 min”, “no sugar”, “express gratitude”).
2. Tracks your daily progress for 7 days.
3. Mints an **Aura NFT** as proof of commitment.
4. Uses **Google OAuth** and Chipi Pay SDK to generate a Web3 wallet with zero friction.
5. Visualizes progress using Supabase and unlocks premium habits via **Stripe**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js + Tailwind + Shadcn
- **Auth + Wallet**: Chipi Pay SDK (Google login)
- **Backend**: Supabase (auth, database, storage)
- **Smart Contracts**: Cairo on Starknet (testnet mint → automatic mainnet mint)
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel + Supabase + Stripe

## 💡 Why Aura?

Aura was born from a personal need to track life-changing habits and visually celebrate discipline.  
Each Aura NFT is a **spiritual digital trophy** — only minted if you stay true to your commitment.

Your wallet becomes a **gallery of integrity and growth**, not just a place for assets.

## 🤖 Role of Artificial Intelligence

Aura was built by a human-led team, heavily assisted by AI tools:

- **ChatGPT**: System logic, UI flows, writing, architecture
- **Copilot**: Backend/frontend code support
- **Midjourney / DALL·E**: Aura visuals and illustrations
- **Notion AI / Claude**: Ideation, flow design, and documentation

Thanks to these tools, Aura was built in record time with a focused vision.
